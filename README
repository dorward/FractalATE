A Catalyst application for managing items for the FATE system.

The name comes from the fractal nature of the game, which allows
the same rules to be applied to describe anything from a person
to a planet.

This is mostly a learning exercise for me to get to grips with 
Catalyst before returning to my rather more insane Axford project
with its inconsitent URIs.
